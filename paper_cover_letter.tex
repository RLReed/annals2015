\opening{Dear Dr. Weaver:} 
 
\noindent Please find enclosed my revised manuscript, 
``An Energy Basis for Response Matrix Methods Based on the Karhunen-LoÂ´eve Transform,'' which I would like 
to submit for publication as a technical article in 
 {\it Annals of Nuclear Energy}.
 
\noindent This article extends on work recently presented at the American
Nuclear Society Annual Meeting.  The extension includes a complete mathematical
development of the methods used, as well as an application of the methods to
additional test problems.  Particularly, this work concentrated on finding an
adequate basis set to expand the energy variable for the Response Matrix
Method.  The basis would be used to link the fidelity of high-group lattice 
physics calculations with the computational speed of low-group transport solvers,
which should be of interest to researchers working with computational
reactor modeling.

\noindent The manuscript has been edited to include revisions suggested by the 
reviewers.  Additionally, several sections of the article have been edited for 
clarity and content to better aid the presentation.

\noindent I confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere 
and is not under consideration by another journal.  In addition, 
I assert that there is no conflict of interests regarding 
the publication of this article.

\noindent I thank you for your consideration and look forward to your 
decision.

\closing{Sincerely,\\
